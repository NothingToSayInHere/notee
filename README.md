## Motivation behind the app

As it has been have figured out, nowadays many people take a lot of notes on their phones as we carry them all the time with us, and we are not an exception.
However, the applications that are present on, for example, Google Play Store, do not fit our needs, as everyone still can access them once their get access to our phones.
This is why we have teamed up to create an app that allows our notes to be stored in a safe manner and with the features we want to have.
